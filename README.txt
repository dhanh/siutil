This is SiUtil_cs.dll, a .Net class that wraps the functionality of the
Silicon Labs' SiUtil.dll, which is a dll that allows developers to 
write custom programmers for Silabs mcus. The problem is that the 
original dll is a windows MFC .dll, and is very hard to use by 
any language except C++.
